## 题目难点
- 本题重点是梳理JS中Chunk Array的用途

    Use Cases:
    
    1. Pagination (分页):

        When implementing pagination in a web application, you often need to split a large list of items into smaller chunks or pages. The chunking operation allows you to divide the items into manageable portions, making it easier to display and navigate through the data.

        ```javascript
        function paginateArray(array, pageSize, pageNumber) {
            // Calculate the starting index of the current page
            const startIndex = (pageNumber - 1) * pageSize;

            // Create a chunk of the array based on the page size
            const chunkedArray = array.slice(startIndex, startIndex + pageSize);

            return chunkedArray;
        }

        // Example usage
        const data = [
        'Racoon 1', 'Racoon 2', 'Racoon 3', 'Racoon 4', 'Racoon 5',
        'Racoon 6', 'Racoon 7', 'Racoon 8', 'Racoon 9', 'Racoon 10'
        ];

        const pageSize = 3; // Number of items per page
        const pageNumber = 2; // Current page number

        const result = paginateArray(data, pageSize, pageNumber);
        console.log(result);
        ```
    
    2. Parallel Processing:

        In parallel computing or distributed systems, data is often divided into chunks and processed simultaneously by multiple processors or nodes. Chunking the data allows for efficient distribution and parallel execution of tasks, improving overall performance.

    3. Image Processing:

        In image processing applications, large images are often divided into smaller blocks or tiles to enable processing and analysis at a more granular level. Each tile can be independently processed, allowing for parallelization and efficient utilization of computational resources.

    4. Data Analysis and Aggregation:

        When dealing with large datasets, it can be beneficial to divide the data into smaller chunks for analysis and aggregation purposes. This approach allows for parallel or distributed processing, enabling faster data processing and efficient resource utilization.
    
    5. File Upload and Transfer:

        When uploading or transferring large files, the data is typically sent in smaller chunks to handle potential network limitations and ensure reliable delivery. The receiving end can process each chunk independently and reassemble them to reconstruct the original file.

    2. Using Slicing

- Why this problem is important? (Interview Tips)
    - What is the purpose of chunking an array?

        Chunking an array allows us to divide a large array into smaller, more manageable subarrays. This can be useful in various scenarios such as pagination, parallel processing, or dividing data for distributed systems.

    - How would you approach chunking an array without using built-in library functions like _.chunk?

        One approach is to use loops and array manipulation techniques. Another approach is to utilize the slice or splice methods to extract chunks of the array. Alternatively, you can use the reduce function to iterate over the array and create subarrays of the desired size.
    
    - Can you explain the difference between chunking an array and splitting an array?

        Chunking an array involves dividing it into smaller subarrays of equal or specified size, while splitting an array typically involves separating it into two or more separate arrays at a given index or based on a condition.
    
    - How would you handle edge cases where the array length is not evenly divisible by the chunk size?

        In such cases, the last subarray may have a length that is less than the specified chunk size. This can be handled by checking the remaining elements and including them in the last subarray.
